# Fridgey

A simple recording app for keeping track of the ingredients at home; with just a few simple setup steps, you can start recording. The app will notify you when ingredients are nearing their expiration, so you no longer have to worry about food spoilage at home!

* âœ… Added food records, including name, expiration date, production date (optional), image (optional), category, and notes (optional).
* âœ… Displayed all food cards on the home page sorted in ascending order of expiration date (cards closer to expiration are shown first).
* âœ… Randomly selected a food item from the refrigerator.
* âœ… Sent notifications within the set nearing expiration range (notifications may not always be reliable due to OEM restrictions on app background activities).
* âœ… Export or import food data through csv file
* âœ… Implement a more concise layout option that omits food images to display more food information on the home page.


## TODO

* ðŸŸ¨ Add quantity and unit to food records.
* ðŸŸ¨ Add a "consume" button (e.g., for eating or using the food for other purposes) to decrement the quantity of food items.
